## Playdate

While I was supposed to be writing<img align="right" src="/assets/images/playdate_webapp.png" width="400" style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 10px"> my thesis, I created a webapp to translate "share" links for artists/albums/songs between streaming services (right now only supports Spotify and Apple Music). The idea came from a friend who uses Apple Music (I use Spotify) and could never open the links I sent him. It's a simple backend that interprets the link you give it and uses the Spotify and Apple Music APIs to find the corresponding link within the other service. Check it out at [https://www.playdate.vip](https://www.playdate.vip).

My friend George Farro made a gorgeous iOS app that communicates with the playdate server so you can easily translate links from your phone and text them to friends:

## "I Want to Believe" Podcast

I and my two co-producers/hosts are finishing up the first season of our podcast, to be released in the first half of 2024. It's called "I Want to Believe", and it's about three "science-minded" guys trying to open themselves up to the weirder, less rationalistic practices people engage with, from psychics to crystals to alternative medicine. We're trying to learn first-hand what people get out of these things we've always tended to reject as "woo-woo", and questioning how our own shortcomings play into our avowed "beliefs".

## Short Film "Up to Here"

During the pandemic, my friends and I found a mysterious craigslist post offering basically unlimited brick-colored ball-pit balls for free. Completely out of ways to spend time, we made this ridiculous thing:
