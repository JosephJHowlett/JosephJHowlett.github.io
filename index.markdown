title: About Me
---

I’m a science journalist with articles in Scientific American, the San Francisco Chronicle, Nature, Science, and Gizmodo, among other places. I also have a PhD in particle physics, and researched gravity and dark matter at Stanford and Columbia University. I’m currently attending the Science Communication Masters Program at UC Santa Cruz, where I’ll graduate in June 2024.
