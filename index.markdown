title: About Me
---

I’m a science journalist and former astroparticle physicist now working as a Staff Reporter at Scientific American. Before that I was the Math Staff Writer at Quanta Magazine, and before that I wrote for places like the New York Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, Nature, Science, and Gizmodo. I have an M.S. in Science Communication from UC Santa Cruz, and a physics Ph.D. from Columbia University.
