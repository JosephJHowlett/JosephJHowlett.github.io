title: About Me
---

I am a particle physicist, currently working as a postdoc at Stanford University under Professor Giorgio Gratta, where I am trying to test the strength of gravity between microscopic objects. I did my PhD at Columbia University, working on the XENON dark matter project in the group of Professor Elena Aprile. My research focuses on the simulation-based statistical models of dark matter and backgrounds used to interpret data from the XENON1T and XENONnT detectors, as well as on the development of new techniques for the efficient purification of liquid xenon, the cryogenic medium that makes up these detectors.
