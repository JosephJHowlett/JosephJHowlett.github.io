Iâ€™m a science journalist and former astroparticle physicist. My work has been published in Scientific American, the San Francisco Chronicle, Nature, Science, Gizmodo, and elsewhere. I'm currently the Math Staff Writer at Quanta Magazine. I have an M.S. in Science Communication from UC Santa Cruz. I also have a physics Ph.D. from Columbia University.
