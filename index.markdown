title: About Me
---

Iâ€™m a science journalist currently writing about physics and math for Quanta Magazine as their summer intern. My work has been published in Scientific American, the San Francisco Chronicle, Nature, Science, and Gizmodo, among other places. I completed my M.S. in Science Communication at UC Santa Cruz in June 2024. I also have a PhD in particle physics, and researched gravity and dark matter at Stanford and Columbia University.
