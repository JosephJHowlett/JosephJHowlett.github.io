title: About Me
---

I'm a science writer and particle physicist currently attending the Science Communication Masters Program at UC Santa Cruz. I got my PhD in physics at Columbia University working on an experiment that tried to find dark matter, then I worked as a Postdoc at Stanford University trying to measure the strength of gravity between microscopic objects. Now I write about all kinds of science as a freelance journalist and as a news intern at SLAC.
